globalsjs - todo list

x1. get unit tests working in new repo
2. finish async version of find()
	--- it looks like one connection to cache/globalsdb cannot handle more than one
			concurrent async call. SO, will need to refactor a bunch, and create new connections
			for each call.
		-- the sync calls can all share one connection
3. work on deamon 
	+ make a "dbcommand" object
	+ BSON it across the wire
	+ BSON results over the wire
	+ refactor calls from client (globalsjs.Db.Collection) to use network 
	+ URL scheme, do what mongojs does
