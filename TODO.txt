globalsjs - todo list

x1. get unit tests working in new repo
x2. finish async version of find()
/*  
	--- it looks like one connection to cache/globalsdb cannot handle more than one
			concurrent async call. SO, will need to refactor a bunch, and create new connections
			for each call.
		-- the sync calls can all share one connection
*/
	---> no - just cannot have multiple open async calls!!!
  	for(var i=0; i<2; i++) {
			db.foo.find({},function(e,r) { console.dir(r); }
		}
		will give sporadic results, usually, Segmentation Fault 11.

3. work on deamon 
	+ make a "dbcommand" object
	+ BSON it across the wire
	+ BSON results over the wire
	+ refactor calls from client (globalsjs.Db.Collection) to use network 
	+ URL scheme, do what mongojs does
